# Origin Defi

## Setup environment

Duplicate `.env` file to `.env.local` and fill the variables with your secrets, they will take precedence over the defaults.

> We use multiple `.env` files in the project, either at the root or in `/apps/<APP_NAME>` folders. They can be nested to increase specificity, more info [here](https://nx.dev/recipes/tips-n-tricks/define-environment-variables)

## Start the app

To start the development server run `pnpm nx serve <APP_NAME>`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Apps

| Status | Name | Nx project | Port | Public hosts |
|:------:|:-----|:-----------|:-----|:-------------|
|   âœ…   | OETH | `oeth`     | 4200 | [fleek](https://defi-oeth.on.fleek.co/)    |
|   ðŸš§   | OUSD | `ousd`     | 4201 |     |

## Storybook

There is a shared storybook aggregator that can run all the stories across all the libraries, run `pnpm storybook`. If you want to run storybook for one individual library (eg: ousd) simply run `pnpm nx storybook defi-oeth` (basically the command is `pnpm nx storybook name-of-the-lib`).

## Translations

Basic translation setup was added to the repo. It might require some changes depending on how we would structure our translations and our modules, but for now it extracts and compiles translations available in the `apps` folder and the appropriate module in in `libs/defi/module-name`.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```bash
pnpm nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```bash
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```bash
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## graphQl

We use `react-query` in conjunction with `graphql-codegen` for interacting with graphQl endpoint. Here's how to use (this example is taken from oeth app):

- write gql colocated to your components, in respective `queries|mutations|subscriptions|fragments.graphql` file
- you get graphql autocompletion based on the schema located in `.graphqlconfig` at the root of the repo
- run the graphql-codegen task with `pnpm nx run oeth-shared:codegen-graphql`, it will generate 
  - the global types in `libs/oeth/shared/src/generated/graphql.ts` and 
  - the generated hooks next to your graphql file (i.e. `/libs/oeth/history/src/queries.generated.tsx`)
- use the generated hooks in your component with fully typed args and results

Couple of things to note:
- generated hooks receives args as first param, second param exposes all react-query api for controlling execution
- react-query http client is automatically injected via codegen, it is defined here `libs/oeth/shared/src/clients/graphql.ts`
- autocompletion is ensured by `.graphqlconfig`, you'll probably need the proper IDE plugin to handle it
- there's a `--watch` flag that you can pass to the codegen if you want to autodetect changes
